<h3>Game Developer and Designer!</h3>

- üë©‚Äçüíª &nbsp; Worked previously at Microsoft and Awesome Black

- üå± &nbsp; Passionate in creating; be it creatively writing, or creating solutions for problems in software development.

- ‚úçÔ∏è &nbsp; Enjoy in my spare time I enjoy writing, reading and playing Video games with friends.

<h2>What am I currently doing?</h2>
Currently, I'm taking part in a wonderful opportunity at Screen Queensland. I will be able to work with a team of individuals to create a Video game together. We will be able to create our own companies without the worry of having to earn a wage.

Currently, I'm a Developer and Designer for On The Hearth, a game all about discovery and learning the book that your mentor has left behind so you can connect with the Village that now relies on you and you rely on them.

<h2> Interested in what I did at Awesome Black</h2>
As their sole Game Developer I got tons of experience inside Unreal Engine. Over this time I created many things for game:

 

- Interaction System
- Inventory System
- Dialogue System
- Puzzles and Objectives
- NPC Movement and controlling

Sadly the game wasn't finished but you can get an idea of the sort of work I can do: <a href="https://github.com/WilloWisp03/Awesome-Black-Game-Mechanics">My Work</a>
